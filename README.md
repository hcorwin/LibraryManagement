LibraryManagement
Simple library management app created with Angular + .NET 6

Back end is a minimal api made in .NET 6 that has some simple features:

-connects to local SQL Server for data access

-global exception handling using middleware

-fast caching on most used endpoint using Scrutor + decorator pattern

-encryption of passwords for registering users

-small test suite with unit + integration tests

*Things I should have but dont (lazy): logging, authorization/authetication, jwt configuration to be passed to front end

*Will update as Angular portion is finished
